        <p>A chosen group of Northwestern contestants compete in a game of strategy, strength and wit until one sole survivor remains on Zoom. Although they weren’t cast away on a deserted island like contestants on the CBS reality show <em>Survivor</em>, these students resolved to outlast one another through social, mental and physical competitions. Now, <em>Survivor Northwestern</em> is filming its second season, with former and current castaways hoping it quickly becomes a campus mainstay.</p>
        <p>Communication second-year Kylie Boyd unsuccessfully applied to the CBS show before joining <em>Survivor Northwestern</em> as a Season 1 castaway and current Season 2 co-host</p>
        <p>“Playing on campus absolutely prepared me if I
            ever end up on the real show,” Boyd says. “The level
            of gameplay on our season, I will confidently say, was
            higher than some of the seasons of actual <em>Survivor</em>.”</p>
            <p>The production consists of students vlogging their
                strategic conversations and competing in weekly
                virtual challenges to form powerful alliances and win
                safety from elimination. </p>

        <p>Last year, Class of 2020 alumnus Chase Reed was the
            show's only producer, which delayed the first season
            release to a potential fall 2021 premiere. To improve
            the efficiency and quality of production, 11 students and
            alumni formed an official production team for Season 2.</p>
        <p>“When you're watching it on TV, there are so many
            question marks because the editing team is crafting
            a story where each of the cast fits a narrative,” says
            Season 2 Executive Producer and Weinberg fourth-year
            Carson Knoer. “I'm really excited to get the opportunity
            with Season 2 to be on the other side and craft those
            stories and craft those narratives for the whole new
            batch of castaways.</p>
        <p> The move to remote classes interrupted Knoer’s
            experience on Season 1, which began in January. Still,
            challenges and gameplay continued virtually.

                “<em>Survivor Northwestern</em> was a godsend,” says Knoer.
                “It gave me the opportunity to reach out and connect
                with people consistently online from home in a way
                that my other student orgs did not.”</p>
            <p> In March, fellow Season 1 castaway Matthew
                Albert turned to his <em>Survivor</em> community when the
                coronavirus hit his hometown of New Rochelle, New
                York. After the SESP third-year’s father contracted the
                virus, Albert was confined to his bedroom.</p>
            <p>“All that I had to brighten up my days was <em>Survivor</em>,”
                Albert says. “When I reflect on my season, and the people who I’ve worked with specifically, I think of
                them as so much more than allies.”</p>
            <p>Season 1 castaway and Season 2 casting director Sami
                DeVries left her season with a ride-or-die friendship
                with Boyd. The two second-year theatre majors bonded
                over their similarities, aligning from the beginning.</p>
            <p>“I love my friends outside of <em>Survivor</em>, but there's
                something really special about the bonds that I have
                with the people that I met on <em>Survivor</em> that I can't
                really get other places,” DeVries says. </p>
            <p>In casting the second season, DeVries aimed for
                a group that represented the diverse interests and
                identities of Northwestern students.</p>
            <p>“We wanted lots of different people with lots of
                different personalities that would mesh well together
                but not mesh too well together,” says DeVries.
                “Whenever we would read applications, we would
                decide what archetype this person could fill.”</p>
            <p>Since the show is not yet a registered student
                organization, the team has been fundraising and
                spending out-of-pocket. As Knoer and other production
                team members watch Season 2 unfold, they already
                plan to film Season 3 in the winter and continue
                growing the organization.</p>
            <p>“Being a part of the inaugural cast is something
                that is really special to me because I do see this being
                present for years to come,” Knoer says. “To be part of
                that first group is really powerful.</p>
