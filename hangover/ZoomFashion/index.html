      <p>
        Zoom poses an existential threat to any student who cares about fashion.
        Without the ability to flex those new Jordans or tout your Canada Goose,
        all Northwestern students could use a little help spicing up their Zoom
        outfits (even though you all keep your cameras off and mics muted
        anyway). For those who want to stunt, this is for you.
      </p>

      <!--MULLET MAGIC-->
      <div>
        <img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/MulletSketch.png" class="right" />

        <h2><span class="blue">Mullet Magic</span></h2>

        <p>
          Mullets pose an age-old question: Is business in the front, party in
          the back truly attainable? Mullets represent the duality of human
          life: beauty and disgust, clean-cut yet ever so flowy, business but
          simultaneously party. With classes online, making risqué choices is
          the name of the game. Invite your favorite barber into your garage,
          gossip about how cute Peyton Ramsey is and wait until class to show
          off the beast on your head.
          <span class="italic"
            >Pro tip: wear a hat for the first hour of class, then take it off
            dramatically (or inconspicuously). Drama x mullet = incalculable
            popularity.</span

      <!--WWE-->
      <div>
        <img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/Wrestler.png" class="left" />
        <h2><span class="blue">WWE</span> (Wild Wildcat Entrance)</h2>
        <p>
          Did WWE Legend Stone Cold Steve Austin just enter the Zoom? No, that
          was just Jimmy from COMP_SCI 111. If you want to make a statement, you
          need to turn that Zoom meeting into a full-blown WWE entrance. You
          need to go to Walmart and buy a WWE belt. You need your mom doing a
          manual strobe light with the flashlight from downstairs. You need an
          entrance song. (Mine? Definitely “Crazy in Love.” No shame.)
          <span class="italic">
            Pro tip: For added suspense, play the intro of your song while the
            camera is still off, whip out the belt and get ready to maybe
            (probably) get kicked out of your Zoom.</span

      <!--SILLY BANDZ-->
      <div>
        <img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/SillyBandz.png" class="right2" />
        <h2>Ice on Ice on <span class="blue">Silly Bandz</span></h2>

        <p>
          Take a walk down Sheridan, and you’ll see lots of Gucci belts, Louis V
          purses and the occasional Gap graphic tee. But, oh no honey, that’s
          not drip. Ice comes in packs of 20 from your local Walmart. Flood your
          wrist with Silly Bandz and flex on all your classmates every time you
          raise your hand to engage in meaningful discussion (because you are a
          Good Northwestern StudentTM). I guarantee your teacher will put some
          respect on your name when they see that misshapen elephant and lime
          green penguin on your forearm.
          <span class="italic"
            >Pro tip: Silly Bandz look best when you also throw on a shade of
            neon Kanye glasses.</span

      <!--RILEY LEES-->
      <div>
        <img src="https://northbynorthwestern.com/content/images/2020/12/RileyLees.png" class="left2" />
        <h2>Riley <span class="blue">Lees</span></h2>
        <p>
          Looking like the hometown football star has never been so easy. In
          just two easy steps, YOU can become fourth-year wide receiver Riley
          Lees. First, order a fake mustache. The mustache must be just bushy
          enough to justify its existence but not cool enough for someone to be
          like “Damn, that boy has a nice mustache.” Second, do not groom
          yourself for a month. This requires dedication, but all art does. Now,
          all you have to do is show up for class and change your boring-ass
          name to “RILEY LEES” on Zoom. For the rest of the quarter, your
          teacher will think you’re on a date with Coach Fitz.
          <span class="italic"
            >Pro tip: If you have a class with Riley Lees, I would highly
            recommend pulling this one on him. It would be timeless and a great
            laugh for everyone else.</span
