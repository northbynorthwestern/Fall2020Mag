      Carl Morison, a Weinberg
      third-year, didn’t bring his
      teddy bear, Teddy, with him
      to Northwestern when he lived
      in a fraternity house. Despite the
      fact that Teddy gave him immense
      comfort when he was stressed out
      or missing home, Teddy found his
      place on a shelf or in the closet.
    </p>
   <p>
    “I didn’t bring Teddy out much
    because I didn’t want to have to
    explain the story to many people,
    and because it might have been
    thought of as odd for a male-
    identifying person to have a stuffed
    animal on his bed,” Morison says.
    As Morison got older, having
    a stuffed animal came with a
    negative stigma — so he began
    to subconsciously look to other
    methods of coping. He started
    running or doing various
    activities outside to help with
    the general stress of college, as
    well as stress-eating snacks and
    watching lots of Netflix.
  </p>
    <p>
      “For homesickness, instead of
      using my Teddy to feel like home,
      I would just call my parents or
      family instead, as this also gave
      a feeling of home. I feel like I
      learned to use these things as
      coping mechanisms to help me
      relax, when I probably could have
      gotten the same effect or better
      from sleeping with my teddy bear,”
      Morison says.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      Having a stuffed animal
      can ameliorate the feeling of
      loneliness or even simply just be
      something to hug. According to
      a 2018 study from OnePoll and
      real estate company Life Storage,
      43% of American adults engage
      with stuffed animals. Despite this
      commonality, a taboo still exists
      — especially as we grow older. But
      for Northwestern students, it can
      provide a sense of comfort that’s
      unlike anything else. <br><i>Photo submitted

    <p>    When she was born, Weinberg
      third-year Caroline Forbess was
      given two blanket bears and slept
      with them every night. Even
      though her parents thought they
      were identical bears, she knew the
      difference between them because
      of their eyes, leading Forbess to
      name one “Clean Bear” and the
      other “Scratchy Bear.”</p>

  <p> Then, when she was 10, her dad
    gave her a basset hound stuffed
    dog, which she named Amy: the
    same name of her dad’s basset
    hound when he was growing up.
    Forbess calls her stuffed animals
    her “lovies,” and they’ve come to
    be some of her most important
    possessions, essential to her
    feeling safe.</p>
   <p>
    “When I was dropped off at
    sleepaway camp for my first time,
    I remember standing outside my
    cabin watching my mom drive
    away. I was crying so much, and I
    was so homesick, but I had Beary
    with me to hug and calm me,”
    Forbess says.
   </p>
   <p>
    Her lovies helped her cope with
    the change and stress of being
    away from home, something
    that has continued throughout
    her time at Northwestern. She
    says they remind her of home
    and family, and they’ve provided
    tremendous support.
   </p>
   <p>
    Forbess has a lot of test
    anxiety, so the night before
    exams, she usually has trouble
    sleeping. Reaching for her lovies
    provides her with the comfort
    and peace of mind she needs to
    calm her nerves. Her lovies have
    helped her navigate the stress
    of Northwestern, and without
    their comfort, she’s not sure if
    she would be able to handle the
    quarter system as well as she does.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    “I have a special way I rub
    them against my face, and it’s so
    soothing. Even though lovies are
    seen as a childhood thing, I believe
    if having your lovies is what helps
    you sleep at night, then you should
    have them with you no matter
    your age,” Forbess says.

      Sven, a plush shark, came into
      Medill and Bienen third-year
      Nadine Manske’s life when she
      was shopping at Ikea the summer
      before college. Manske knew she
      wanted something comforting to
      take with her, and when she saw
      the bucket full of plush sharks,
      she knew she was going to take
      one home.
    </p>
   <p>
    “I remember that it wasn’t my
    intention to pick him up. I think I
    was there to look at other furniture
    for my dorm, or running errands
    with my family, and I saw the bin
    of sharks and I knew I had to take
    one home with me. It wasn’t even
    a question; I just knew I had to
    have him,” Manske says.
   </p>

    <p>
      Because she got him right
      before going away to school, Sven
      has symbolically been helping her
      throughout the transition to being
      away from home and everything
      since then. Sven has been an
      easy, low-maintenance source of
      comfort for Manske — especially
      with her mental health.
    </p>

    <p>
      “There are some times when
      your brain is too full of everything
      and you just want to sit there with
      your Ikea shark,” Manske says.
      When she’s stressed, she hugs
      Sven. To her, having a way to
      ground yourself with a physical
      source of constant support and
      comfort is really important.

      Stuffed animals have always
      been a part of Medill third-year
      Sophia Lo’s life; since she was a
      little girl, she’s had a collection of
      them that continues to grow. Lo
      found Alfie, a life-size plush bear,
      on Northwestern’s “Free & For Sale”
      Facebook group. She then knew she
      had to bring her giant plush hamster,
      Sesame, who she won at Six Flags,
      back with her to Northwestern so
      Alfie the bear could have a friend.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Lo drove from New Jersey to
      Evanston with two friends and an
      extra seat in the car for Sesame,
      but the car was packed so tightly
      that Sesame stayed in Lo’s lap
      the entire time. Lo created a
      Twitter feed to document the
      trip, where Sesame ate egg and
      cheese bagels and took naps
      with Lo in the car.
    </p>

    <p>
      “It was a lot of fun coming up
      with tweets and taking pictures
      along the way. My favorite
      picture is the one where Sesame
      is pumping his gas for the first
      time because he is from New
      Jersey,” Lo says.
    </p>

    <p>
      Growing up, stuffed animals
      have always been comforting for
      Lo, and at school she has a bunch,
      including three Squishmallows.
      They help her with stress, as they
      can be something fun to touch
      or play with. Many of her stuffed
      animals were actually given to her
      rather than purchased herself.
      Even though Lo agrees they can
      be for little kids, they’re always
      going to be a part of her life.

      Muchi the stuffed cow came
      into Weinberg third-year Nathalie
      Fuhrman’s life when she was 5
      years old. Since then, Muchi has
      slept with her every night.
      “He went through all of high
      school and college so far with
      me,” Fuhrman says. “He’s now
      molded so he fits perfectly in
      the shape that I put my arms in
      when I sleep.”
    </p>

    <p>
      If sad or upset, Fuhrman
      would hug Muchi, who has been
      in her life for so long that his
      comfort is natural to her. When
      on a family vacation in Portugal,
      she forgot Muchi on the hotel
      bed in the rush to the airport.
      Frantic, Fuhrman begged her
      parents to get him back; the
      hotel ended up shipping Muchi
      back to the United States for
      her, but she had to pay the
      international shipping fee.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I paid probably more than
      he’s worth to get him shipped
      back home. I don’t know how to
      explain it, Muchi just feels like a
      part of me; I couldn’t lose him,”
      Fuhrman says.
    </p>

    <p>
      When leaving for college,
      Fuhrman was sure to pack Muchi
      along with her. She reaches for
      him whenever she is homesick
      at Northwestern and especially
      when the challenges of school
      become more demanding. Muchi
      has been something constant for
      her throughout her whole life,
      and without him, Fuhrman’s not
      sure what she’d do.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Leaving home to a place
      where you don’t know anyone is
      scary. That was a way for me to
      have a comfort of home with me,”
      Fuhrman says.
