        <p>Throughout the summer, Weinberg first-year Madeline Southwell tried “not to get [her] hopes up.” With a pandemic sweeping the world, it was unlikely she would be on campus fall quarter. But in emails and updates, Northwestern administrators kept reassuring her she would be. When she tested negative for COVID-19 August 28, living on campus seemed like a reality, and her family toasted her send-off at a celebratory dinner. Fifteen minutes later, she came back to tell them she wouldn’t be allowed on campus.</p>
        <p>Across the Atlantic in the United Kingdom, Antonia Carlsson was awake at 6 A.M. with questions running through her mind. She spent three hours sending emails, she said, worried her visa would force her to go to the U.S. if she was unable to have it deferred.</p>
        <p>After months assuring first-years and second-years they would be able to live on campus, President Morton Schapiro sent an email August 28 retracting his plans — nine days before move-in. </p>
        <p>The decision left freshman and sophomores questioning everything. What motivated the change? Why hadn’t students been informed earlier? Southwell questioned why only upperclassmen were allowed, saying the decision was “shocking” although she said she believed the university acted in the best interest of its community.</p>
        <p>During his final return-to-campus discussion, held September 1, Shapiro acknowledged the last-minute decision. He said he made the choice to walk back plans August 27.</p>
        <p>“Till the middle of last week, I was absolutely convinced we could pull this off,” Shapiro said during the talk. </p>
        <p>Associate Vice President of Research at Northwestern Medicine Dr. Richard D’Aquila  said administrators decided to reverse the decision due to rising cases and a new estimation of the required number of quarantine beds. According to Shapiro, the school’s latest calculations suggested the 609 rooms the school had available for quarantine would be full within 7 to 10 days. </p>
        <p>Chloe Chow, a freshman, was surprised that the university underestimated quarantine numbers, noting they “ knew how many students there would be.” The email surprised everyone, she said. “People called into housing on Friday, and they said to bring your stuff in.” Chow’s dorm stuff now lies in a pile in her basement.</p>
        <p>Several members of the administration did not respond to requests for comment. By email, Phil Asbury, Northwestern’s Director of Financial Aid, said “these topics are too easily misunderstood so we are being careful and fairly sparse in our response.”</p>
        <p>Now, freshman and sophomores in remote social isolation lead strange, exhausting lives, with some affected more than others. International students like Carlsson found themselves isolated by their timezone. “I feel like I’m on the outskirts, looking in,” Carlsson said.</p>
        <p>Carlsson, who has chronic fatigue syndrome, now “gets up with the sun,” with the heavy coursework making it hard for her to sleep some nights. “It’s kind of like you’re ill until the point where you can’t move,” she said. </p>
        <p>“I just generally feel pretty lost and unmotivated,” Southwell said, describing the experience as “disorienting.” She said she can sometimes “drift away” from feeling like she’s part of the student body at all.</p>
        <p>Maggie Sullivan, a Northwestern freshman in Nashville, Tennessee, said that motivation is a struggle without tangible connections to teachers and classmates. She can’t shake the feeling that “my professor is a series of pixels and a handful of emails, rather than a real human person.”</p>
        <p>On Oct. 28, Schapiro emailed the student body to confirm that freshman and sophomores would come to campus in winter “based on where we stand today.” He acknowledged a surge in cases in Evanston, but committed to keeping positivity rates low on campus as more students moved in.</p>
        <p>As freshman and sophomores consider whether they will come to campus, some also wonder whether they can trust this decision at all. Chow predicted the administration would “take it back in late November.” She resolved not to get excited “until a week before.”
